# Parker_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project Overview:
  My project will be a program that randomly generates a graph with 100 nodes, each with 4 adjacent verticies.  It then will implement two (maybe three) different shortest path algorithms to find the shortest distance between two given points.  The algorithm will count the number of steps required to find the shortest path and will then print out the results. It will have options to refresh the graph, print the graph, and print the shortest path (with steps).
